# Jambo

Object mapper framework for .net

## DB Provider
We are working with Sql Server 2014+ but we want to add support for diferent providers as well. The framework was build with that in mind so it will happen!

## Supporters
I want to express my gratitude to [Brain Tunnelgenix Technologies](https://github.com/orgs/BTTCorp) who accepted Jambo as it's ORM framework of choise, offering us a real world application where our framework could mature.
